# Notes app
This is my personal fullstack project. It's a simple notes app. You can add, edit and delete notes. For every note you can give a tag and you can filter the notes
with the tags you've given to them.

The app is currently hosted at https://main.d1l80yr06bwvjg.amplifyapp.com/ without working backend, next step is to get the backend to work.
